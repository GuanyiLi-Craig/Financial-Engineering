# Week 6 Quiz

## Instruction

This quiz focuses on the simplico gold mine example. You should download the associated Excel spreadsheet and the Simplico Notes PDF file \([here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/financialengineering2/supplement/WjA8p/lesson-supplements)\) before attempting the quiz and make sure you understand all the calculations in those files.

In this quiz we want to compute the value of the enhancement option when the enhancement costs $5 million but raises the mining capability by 40% to 14,000 ounces at an operating cost of $240 per ounce. Moreover, due to technological considerations, you should assume that the enhancement \(should it be required\) will not be available until the beginning of the fifth year.

## Quiz 1

Compute the time t=0 value of the mine when the enhancement is already in place.

## Quiz 2

Compute the time t=0 value of the mine when the lease enhancement is not in place but you do have the option to perform the enhancement, i.e. install the new equipment, at the beginning of the fifth year or any later point in the lifetime of the lease.

## Quiz 3

Suppose you own the lease on the mine and the option to enhance the mine in year 5 or later. Assuming you behave optimally, what is the earliest period in which there is a strictly positive probability that you will enhance the mine, i.e. install the new equipment?

## Quiz 4

Suppose you own the lease on the mine and the option to enhance the mine in year 5 or later. Assuming you behave optimally, how many time periods are there in which there is a strictly positive probability that you will actually enhance the mine, i.e. install the new equipment?
