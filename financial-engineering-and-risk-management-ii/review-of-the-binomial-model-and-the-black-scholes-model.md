# Review of the Binomial Model and the Black-Scholes Model

## Binomial Model for Option Pricing

### Pricing a European Call Option

Assumptions:

* expiration at $$t = 3$$ 
* strick $$= $100$$ 
* $$R = 1.01$$ 

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2872%29.png)

* Sample calculation:

$$15.48 = \cfrac{1}{1.01} [q_u \times 22.5 + q_d \times 7]$$ 

with $$q_u = \cfrac{R-d}{ u - d}, \; q_d = 1 -q_u$$ 

* We can also calculate the price as following
  * this is risk-neutral pricing in the binomial model
  * avoid having to calculate the price at every node

$$C_0 = \cfrac{1}{R^3} \mathbf{E}_0^{\mathbb{Q}} [\max(S_T - 100, 0)]$$ 

### Trading Strategies in the Binomial Model

* Let $$S_t$$ denote the stock price at time $$t$$ 
* Let $$\color{red}{B_t}$$ denote the value of the cash-account at time $$t$$ 
  * assume without any loss of generality that $$B_0 = 1, s.t. , B_t = R^t$$ 
  * so now explicitly viewing the cash account as a security
* Let $$x_t$$ denote number of shares held between times $$[t - 1, t], \text{ where } t = 1,2,...,n$$ 
* Let $$y_t$$ denote number of cash account held between times $$[t-1, t],\text{ where } t = 1, 2, ..., n $$ 
* Then $$\bm{\theta}_t := (x_t, y_t)$$ is the portfolio held:
  * immediately after trading at time $$t-1$$ so it is known at time $$t-1$$ 
  * immediately before trading at time $$t$$ 
* $$\bm{\theta}_t$$ is also a random process and in particular, a **trading strategy**

### Self-Financing Trading Strategies

**Definition.** The _value process_  , $$V_t(\bm{\theta})$$ , associated with a trading strategy, $$\bm{\theta}_t = (x_t, y_t),$$ is defined by

$$V_t = \begin{cases}  x_1 S_0 + y_1 B_0 \quad \text{ for } t =0 \\ x_t S_t + y_t B_t \quad \text{ for } t > 0 \end{cases}$$ 

**Definition.** A self-financing \(s.f.\) trading strategy is a trading strategy, $$\bm{\theta}_t = (x_t, y_t)$$, where changes in $$V_t$$ are due entirely to trading gains or losses, rather than the addition or withdrawal of cash funds. In particular, a s.f. strategy satisfies 

$$V_t = x_{t+1} S_t + y_{t+1} B_t, \quad t = 1, 2, ... , n-1$$ 

* The definition states that the value of a s.f. portfolio just before trading is equal   to the value of the portfolio just after trading
  * so no funds have been deposited or withdrawn

**Proposition.** If a trading strategy, $$\bm{\theta}_t$$ , is s.f. then the corresponding value process, $$V_t$$ , satisfies

$$V_{t+1} - V_t = x_{t+1} (S_{t+1} - S_t) + y_{t+1}(B_{t+1} - B_t)$$ 

so that changes in portfolio value can only be due to capital gains or losses and not the injection or withdrawal of funds.

* In the multi-period binomial model we can construct a s.f. trading strategy   that replicates the payoff of the option
  * this is called dynamic replication.
* The initial cost of this replicating strategy must equal the value of the   option
  * otherwise thereâ€™s an arbitrage opportunity.
* The dynamic replication price is of course equal to the price obtained from   using the risk-neutral probabilities and working backwards in the lattice.
* And at any node, the value of the option is equal to the value of the   replicating portfolio at that node.

### The Replication Strategy for European Option

* Sample calculation

$$0.802 \times 107 + (-74.84) \times 1.01 = 10.23$$ at upper node at time $$t=1$$ 

## The Black-Scholes Model

Black-Scholes assumes

* A continuously-compounded interest rate of $$r$$ 
* Geometric Brownian motion dynamics for the stock price, $$S_t, $$ so that 

$$S_t = S_0 \cdot e^{(\mu-\sigma^2/2)t + \sigma W_t}$$ 

where $$W_t $$ is a _standard Brownian motion_

* The stock pays a dividend yield of $$c$$ 
* Continuous trading with no transactions costs and short-selling allowed. 

If number of period $$n \to \infty$$ then binomial paths will looks like Brownian paths. 

### The Black-Scholes Formula

* In the binomial model the call option price is given by

$$C_0 = \mathbf{E}_0^{\mathbb{Q}} [e^{-rT} \max(S_T - K, 0)]$$ 

where $$q_u = \cfrac{R-d}{u-d}$$ and $$q_d = 1- q_u$$ 

* Assume $$n \to \infty$$ then the Black-Scholes GBM model is obtained s.t. 

$$S_t = S_0 \cdot e^{(r - c - \sigma^2/2) t + \sigma W_t}$$ 

and where $$W_t$$ is a Brownian motion under $$\mathbb{Q}$$ .

* Combine above two equations to obtain the Black-Scholes formula

$$C_0 = S_0 \cdot e^{-cT} \cdot N(d_1) - K\cdot e^{-rT} \cdot N(d_2)$$ 

where 

$$d_1 = \cfrac{\log(S_0 / K) + (r - c + \sigma^2/2) \cdot T}{\sigma \cdot \sqrt{T}} \\ d_2 = d_1 - \sigma \cdot \sqrt{T}$$ 

and $$N(d)  = \mathbf{P} (N(0,1) \leq d)$$
