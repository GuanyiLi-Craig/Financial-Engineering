# Week 3 Quiz

## Instructions

Download the spreadsheet [EquityDerivsPractice\_PSet3.xlsx](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/fe2/class_resources/EquityDerivsPractice_PSet3.xlsx) from the Course platform. The first worksheet, _"DemoSheet"_, displays the profit and loss from selling 100,000 European call options and then delta-hedging these options by following a self-financing trading strategy that attempts to replicate the payoff of these options. The details are given in the slides and one of the video modules. You can use the results in this worksheet to debug your Excel calculations for the questions below.

In the second worksheet, _"StockPricePaths"_, you will find four new price paths for the security. Your task in the questions below is to determine the performance of the delta-hedging strategy for each of these four price paths and relate the performance to the _realized volatility_ of each price path.

Once you have completed this quiz you should compare the realized volatilities with the implied volatility parameter \(30% in the spreadsheet\) that was used to price the options initially and construct the self-financing hedging strategies.

In particular, you should note what sort of price paths \(high volatility or low volatility\) tend to lead to an ultimate hedging profit and which types tend to lead to a loss. \(Note that once you have completed the quiz you can also start experimenting with this implied volatility parameter if you wish to do so. You may also want to try to generalize your Excel formulas to handle an arbitrary number of hedging periods \(currently 50\) as well as European put options.\)
