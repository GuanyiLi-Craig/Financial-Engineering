# How Do Firms Manage Financial Risks

## Reasons for Risk Management

* The efficient market hypothesis does not reflect the true conditions prevailing in the market.
  * Transaction costs, taxes, arbitrage\* opportunities and costs of information almost always exist.
* Although the efficient market hypothesis recognizes default risk, it disregards the high costs of financial distress\* and bankruptcy
  * Perspective: the 2007/2009 financial crisis forced US Gov to pump well over $800 billion into the financial system
* Agency risks
  * Managers or “agents” in general may not act in the best interests of the principal.
* Tax Incentives
  * Volatile earnings induce\* higher taxation than stable earnings
  * Hedging increases the debt capacity of firms; This increases interest tax deductions\*
  * Firms may use derivatives for tax avoidance\*

* _arbitrage_
  * a kind of hedged investment meant to capture slight differences in price; when there is a difference in the price of something on two different markets the arbitrageur simultaneously buys at the lower price and sells at the higher price
  * v. practice arbitrage, as in the stock market
* _distress_
  * n.
    * psychological suffering

      _"the death of his wife caused him great distress"_

    * a state of adversity \(danger or affliction or need\)

      _"a ship in distress"; " she was the classic maiden in distress"_

    * extreme physical pain

      _"the patient appeared to be in distress"_

    * the seizure and holding of property as security for payment of a debt or satisfaction of a claim

      _"Originally distress was a landlord's remedy against a tenant for unpaid rents or property damage but now the landlord is given a landlord's lien"_
  * v. cause mental pain to
* _induce_
  * cause to arise

    _"induce a crisis"_

  * cause to do; cause to act in a specified manner

    _"The ads induced me to buy a VCR"_

  * cause to occur rapidly
  * reason or establish by induction
* _deduction_
  * a reduction in the gross amount on which a tax is calculated; reduces taxes by the percentage fixed for the taxpayer's income bracket

## Hedging Operations vs Hedging Financial Positions

* A firm can choose to hedge against volatilities related to its operations
  * It may hedge the cost of an input material required for firm's operations
  * That way, a firm can concentrate on its core business
* Hedging currency exposures to reduce the risk of losses in exports constitutes\* an example of hedging risks related to operations. 

### Hedge Risks

* If the marketplace is assumed to be **perfect**
  * Then there's no need to hedging, it won't alter the financial health of a firm
  * If hedging is attempted, this would also be even for both the parties in the hedge, as both will have equal information about the market
* If the market is **inefficient**
  * Then there can be **benefits from hedging** to one party in the transaction, like increase of debt capacity and tax advantage, economies of scale or by having comparatively better information than individual investors. 
  * Firms also essentially hedge their operations and if they hedge their financial positions, they should be transparent about their policies.

**Accepting** some form of risk, **hedging** other risks and **managing** hedging costs constitute the **core activities underlying\* risk management.**

## Risk Management in Practice

### The Objective

* Clear decisions on pertinent\* matters are required. There should be clear objectives/end goals
* Risk appetite\* of the firm should be determined by the board of directors
  * It should include the type of risks and the limits for losses with confidence levels
  * The board of directors may also establish the risk tolerance level
  * Risk adjusted net present value can be used to screen projects for increasing sustainability and profitability of the firm
* The board should clearly set objectives so that both debt holders and shareholders are taken care of.
* The board should set out the policy clearly whether accounting or economic, long term or short term profits are to be hedged
* The time horizon for risk management activities should be set by the board
* Putting hedges in place using derivatives may have implications\* on taxes, liquidity, and accounting of a firm.
  * The fact that a futures contract is marked to market while the commodity being hedged may be supplied at the end of contract has implications on the accounts of a firm
  * Profit form an option position is taxed on the end of a taxation year
  * The management should be given clear instructions about the time limits of hedging activities. 

### Words

{% hint style="info" %}

  * having precise or logical relevance to the matter at hand

    _"a list of articles pertinent to the discussion"_

  * being of striking appropriateness and pertinence

  * a logical relation between propositions p and q of the form \`if p then q'; if p is true then q cannot be false
  * a relation implicated by virtue of involvement or close connection \(especially an incriminating involvement\)

    _"he was suspected of implication in several robberies"_

## Managing Risk

### Assessment\* of Magnitudes of Risks

* Is required after a general policy structure pertaining\* to risk management has been set up by the board of directors
* Officials from the firm should identify the risks affecting their divisions, should record all the assets and liabilities\* which have exposure to the risks, and should list orders falling in the horizon set for hedging activities
* Once the business risk, market risk, credit risk and risks associated with operations are identified, the management should look into appropriate instruments\* to hedge the risks

### Instruments for Risk Management

* Internal hedging
  * The use of firm's liabilities and assets to hedge exposures by assuming offsetting positions within the firm
* Firms may decide to use either exchange traded or over the counter \(OTC\) instruments to hedge their risks
* **Exchange traded** instruments are standardized products with maturities\* and strikes\* set in advance while over the counter derivatives are traded by investment banks etc. and can be tailored\* to firm's needs
  * The size of the contract, strike, and maturity can all be customized 
* **Over-the-counter \(OTC\)** is done directly between two parties, without the supervision of an exchange.
  * The credit risk is higher for OTC contracts as compared to exchanges traded instruments
  * A firm should take into account the liquidity and transaction costs related to the instruments that is wants to use for hedging.

## Devising and Implementing a Strategy

### Strategy for Hedging

* Access to all relevant information, data, and statistical tools is required to frame a strategy for hedging
  * The risk management team should have background knowledge of the statistical tools used in hedging
* Static strategies are more of a hedge and forget kind of strategies, where a hedge is placed to almost exactly match the underlying exposure and this hedge remains in place till the exposure ends
* Dynamic strategies require more managerial effort and involve a sequence of trades that are used to offset the exposure as much as possible
  * They may also result in higher transaction costs and require monitoring of positions closely. 

### The Horizon

* For the hedging position and accounting considerations related to the hedge often have important implications for the way the strategy is planned. 
* Accounting rules require that marked-to-market profit or loss be duly recorded if the position in a derivative and underlying asset are not perfectly matched with regards to dates and quantities. 
* Tax laws vary among counties and there are differences in tax laws for different derivatives

## Performance Evaluation

### Evaluation of Risk Management System

* It is necessary and an assessment of overall objective realization should be made.
* Hedging refers to the reduction of risk and it does not imply a profit or a loss
  * A party which has successfully implemented a hedge may well run into a loss
* A risk manager should be able to manage transaction costs inclusive of taxes
* The whole risk management process should be limited within the budget constraints set out prior to the hedge being placed
* The board of directors may address and change the policies in place and oblige\* to the regulatory\* requirements.
