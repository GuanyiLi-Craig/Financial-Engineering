# The Governance of Risk Management

## Link Between Corporate Governance and Risk Management

* Corporate governance refers to the system of rules, practices, and controls put in place by a firm to ensure accountability, transparency, and achievement of long-term goals. 
* Risk management it a critical part of corporate governance.
  * It's important for firms to come up with clear rules, regulations, and procedures that govern all risk management activities
  * Failure of the risk management function is almost always blamed on improper governance
* Recent corporate failures including the 2007/2009 financial crisis have largely been attributed to a lack of transparency and breakdown in the transmission of relevant information to decision makers. 

## Corporate Governance and Risk Management are Inseparable

* From a corporate governance perspective, the board has a primary objective to prioritize and look after the interests of shareholders
  * With that comes the need to identify the risks the business needs to assume so as to generate a return for the shareholders
* The board also has to look after the interests of debt holders
  * While appraising\* any capital project, the board needs to assess the project's riskiness and the probability of insolvency\*, which could be detrimental\* to debt holders
* Recent events have served to align\* the goals of corporate governance with those of risk management, giving rise to "risk governance"
  * For instance, firms worldwide have adopted a governance structure where the CEO and board chairman are two separate offices. The aim is to further strengthen the independence of the board such that members can evaluate the risk profiles of projects presented to them without bias or compromise\*.

## Risk Governance

### The Responsibility of the Board of Directors

* Steer\* the firm according to the interests of the shareholders
* Look after the interests of other stakeholders such as debt holders while developing strategies at the corporate level
* Ensure the sustainability of projects/profits
* Keep an eye on agency risks i.e. conflict of interests between the management and stakeholders

Governance roles should be independent of executive roles, i.e. the board and the CEO should act independently of each other

There's a global push to have firms appoint chief risk officers \(CROs\) who attend board meetings and report directly to the board. 

### Board Members Must Understand Business Strategies and Associated Risk

* The risks associated with business activities should be made transparent to the stakeholders
* An appropriate risk appetite should be set for the firm and board should oversee the managerial activities and strategy formulation process
  * Risk management has to be part of business planning
  * Risks associated with every target should be properly assessed to see if they fit into the firm's risk appetite

### The Risk Management Compass\*

For every risk, a firm has four basic choices

* Accept 
  * Firm take all the risk
* Mitigate
  * Preventive\*/detective measures
  * Firm take part of the risk
* Transfer
  * Insurance/outsourcing
  * Firm eliminate the risk and transfer to others
* Reject

### Key Points

Risk management strategies should be directed to impact economic performance rather than accounting performance.

* Policies, directives, and infrastructure related to risk management should be properly placed in a firm
* Align risk and reward
  * The board should make sure that staff get rewarded according to their risk-adjusted performance
  * This checks fraud related to financial manipulation and stock price boosting
* The board should check the quality and reliability of information about risks
* The board should be educated on risk management and should be able to determine the appropriate risk appetite for the firm
  * There should also be an assessment of risk metrics over a specified time horizon that the board may set.
* Some technical sophistication\* is required to build clear strategies and directives in relation to key risk disciplines\*
  * A risk committee of the board should be qualified enough to handle these technicalities 
  * The risk committee should be separate from the audit committee on grounds of difference in skills and responsibilities.

## Role of Audit Committee of the Board

* The audit committee verifies the activities of the firm to see if the reports outline the same.
* It ensures that a bank complies with standards in regulatory, risk management, legal and compliance activities. 

## The Role of Risk Advisory Director

* Presence of nonexecutives without any risk management expertise in the board may create an environment where decisions are made in a manner not so well thought-out.

  * Oversee development of risk management policies and reports 
  * Oversee financial reporting and the dealings between the firm and its associates
  * Ensure compliance with regulatory requirements

## Roles and Responsibilities in Practice

### How Risk Governance Mechanisms Work

* A recommendation about the risk appetite of the firm is given to the risk committee of the board, by the senior risk committee. 
  * The senior risk committee determines the financial and non-financial risk in line with the risk appetite. 
  * The risk committee of the board approves the risk appetite for the bank. 
  * It also delegates\* authority to the senior risk committee.
* The senior risk committee documents and enforces policies pertaining\* to risk and delegates business level risk limits to the chief risk officer. 
  * It delegates to the CRO the authority to approve excess risks in various lines of business. 
  * It reviews and approves the risk limits of all the business units in the bank. 
* The CRO frames the bank's risk management strategy and risk methodologies and is responsible for the infrastructure for corporate risk governance. 
  * CRO monitors the risk limits for all the business units and communicates the decisions and viewpoint of the board across the organization. 
  * CRO delegates some of the risk management responsibilities to the heads of business units
* The business risk committee may be constituted at major business levels to look into the decisions and strategies of businesses so that they are in line with the risk appetite of the firm. 
  * It sets out strategies and directives for business-level risk management and review
* In a bank, the operation function is important for risk management as its function incorporates booking and settling trades and reconciliation\* of front and back ends. 
  * The finance function of banks frames the policy related to valuation and finance and also ensures the reliability and integrity of P&L reports

* Monitors the adequacy and reliability of the documentation
* Examines the integrity and independency of position data and that of management information system
* Reviews the design of financial rates database, which is used to generate parameters for VaR models, and things like risk management system upgrade

  * As can be seen from the subprime crisis in the United States
* To be on the safe side, every firm must have clear risk management policies such that everyone understands their role, and directives have a clear pathway.
* The risk committee should participate in framing risk management methodologies and they should have appropriate knowledge of risk & metrics
* Economic capital can be used to set risk limits and they can also be used to determine the profitability of various business lines.
* Compensation schemes should be aligned with risk management
