# Mortgage

## Mortgage Mathematics & Security

* Mortgage Backed Securities \(MBS\) are a particular class of asset-backed securities \(ABS\)
  * Assets backed by underlying pools of securities such as
    * mortgage
    * auto-loans
    * credit-card receivables
    * student loans etc
  * The process by which ABS are created is often called securitization.

* Process of securitization
  * Combined the mortgages into a mortgage pool
  * Categrate the mortgages into different securities labeled by tranches, each with different risk and etc. 
  * Why? to share the risk
* We will look at some examples of MBS but first must consider the mathematics   of the underlying mortgages.
* There are many different types of mortgages including: 
  * **level-payment mortgages** 
  * **adjustable-rate mortgages \(ARMs\)** 
    * subprime crisis
  * **balloon mortgages** 
  * and others. 
* We will only consider level-payment mortgages 
  * but MBS may be constructed out of other mortgage types as well. 
* The construction of MBS is an example of securitization 
  * the same ideas apply to asset-backed securities more generally

## Mortgage Mathematics

### Basics for Level-Payment Mortgage

We consider a standard level-payment mortgage

* Initial mortgage principal is $$M_0 := M$$ 
* We assume equal periodic payments of size B dollars.
